# Georgia Reeder

***Note:*** *this is a WinterBoard theme. There are tons of tutorials on how to install them*

I really love Georgia as my reading font and thus when Reeder for iPhone didn't provide me a choice I decided to fix it myself. A short trial-and-error session with WinterBoard helped to gasp its absolute power and here it is: the Georgia fix anyone can use to read the articles in Reeder with serif fonts. 

**P.S.** In fact you can use any fonts you like with this hack. Just fork it and edit the font info to use the font you like.

**P.P.S.** I'll try to hack around and transform the whole interface to use serif fonts. Will push an update if I'll find a way to do it safely.
